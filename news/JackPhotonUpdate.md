Updates to the
[Jack Photon Archive](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Jack+Photon%27s+4.0th+Fantaversary+Revision+FASA+Star+Trek%22&sort=-week).
S10.1 Character Sheets' sole revision is to the Sibling table on the personal notes page. S11.3 Combat Grids gets the
11x17 1701 control panels and put missing coordinates on graph paper grid. GM 21.2 NPC Pack Security/Services saw
additional typos corrected iirc. For those with an 11x17 printer, there are now simple character folders and a GM Screen
'protector' in addition to 8.5x11 spine labels for those binding their pdfs. For those with access to a 13x19 printer or
print shop, single-sheet cover wrappers with interior-fold graphics for all the books so far and some not yet made.
