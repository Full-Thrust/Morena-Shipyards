Discussion on Facebook with [David Deitrick's](https://davidr3deitrick.wordpress.com) on why he hates the cover of the Dixie Gambit with a passion. He was suffering with arthiritis at the time and the two characters on the cover were a rushed job while in pain and working on a huge Battletech project the house book and other distractions.
