- [Errata for my Book 1: Lifeform Readings Character Generation rule book](https://archive.org/details/b-01-errata-250601). Includes 120 new professions for citizens; revised medals tables in a couple cases; and scattered annotations, revisions and clarifications throughout.
- [GM Screen Notions](https://archive.org/details/jp-gmscreen-notions), musing on the contents for 11 sets of screens with 4 themes each.  They will contain new outer skins of screen grabs from the show.
- [Revised character sheet supplement](https://archive.org/details/s-10-character-sheets-full-q-230101), hopefully for the last time ...
- [Revised Jack Photon product list](https://archive.org/details/jp-master-product-list), containing all theoretical releases I have in mind, time permitting.
